# WSO2 On-premise User Store Agent
WSO2 On-premise User Store Agent is a lightweight MSF4J (WSO2 Microservices Framework for Java) service which is used by the WSO2 Identity Cloud to connect to the on-premise userstores.

## Key Features
*  Authenticate users in LDAP userstore.
*  Retrieve attributes of users in LDAP userstore.
*  Retrieve roles of a user in LDAP userstore.
*  Secure configuration files through Ciphertool.
*  Secure Endpoint through JWT security interceptor.

## System Requirements
1. Minimum memory - 512MB
2. Processor - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum
3. Java SE Development Kit 1.8
4. To build WSO2 On Premise Agent from the Source, it is also necessary that you have Maven 3 or later.

       and ciphertool configurations.

### Securing sensitive information in configuration files.
There are sensitive information such as passwords in the configuration. You can secure them by using secure vault. 
Please go through following steps to secure them.

  1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool script from CARBON_HOME directory.
    `ciphertool.sh` (in UNIX)
    
This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files, that have been defined in cipher-tool.properties, with alias token       values.   
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.    
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class.   

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files can be found at conf/security directory.
